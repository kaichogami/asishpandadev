Parts are easy especially after AI has punched us in the face to acknowledge its existence. Telling a computer to do something was something reserved to coders. They translated tasks into a language a computer would understand.

But now, if you know English or any language which the AI supports, you can talk to computer. No need of coding. No need to learn the maths behind it.

Lets say you are a designer and you got a client. They need a landing page.

You, a designer talk to client and understand their market. You get all the information needed. Time to work.

A landing page parts are:

Navigation

Hero

Body

Footer

If you don’t understand these parts, its fine. Whats important that these are parts.

Now your job as a designer is to design these parts and connect them.

You can design the parts yourself or take help of AI. AI is your slave after all.

AI can come up with hundreds of designs in minutes based on the information you give.

“A hero section with purple color background, left side heading and subtitle below. A button which says ‘contact us’. Make the borders curved.”

So you have many hero section to play with. Pick the part you like, change it and stitch it.

Of course if you don’t know the parts well it will be hard for you to judge what AI is doing. A hero section without a heading is no hero section.

So knowing it is a must. But a designer has to weave its part together to make it click.

And it is not website design. If you write and want to get information tell AI to do it. You have to connect it well with your style.

Or as a coder you don’t have to write all the functions. Tell AI what function needs to do. And connect them.

In all jobs and work AI can be an assistant while you connect the parts. So thats what you want to learn. Connecting stuff. Because AI cannot do it.

“But AI can connect dots. It can go and search the websites, criticize itself and give you something”.

True. To some extent it can chain things together.

It can chain things to build a landing page after looking at 10 samples.

It may or may not be good.
It may or may not match with the brand.
It may or may not look generic.

AI doesn’t know if it is good or not.

To make it better you have to tell AI to do it. Guide it with prompts. And to guide it you have to first connect the dots.

AI is slave capable of doing wide ranging tasks. But it doesn’t know to put together the tasks to create a whole. Thats your role.

See you next week! \:D
